**Machine Learning Algorithms Implementation**<br/>

This repository contains complete implementation of machine learning algorithms required for data science.<br/>
I have attached the databases used in the models and have added comments as per my understanding and for your reference.<br/>

Here is a list of algorithms in sequence:<br/>
1. Linear Regression<br/>
2. Logistic Regression<br/>
3. Decision Tree<br/>
4. Random Forest<br/>
5. k-Nearest Neighbor(KNN)<br/>
6. Support Vector Machine(SVM)<br/>
7. k-Means Clustering <br/>
8. Hierarchical Clustering<br/>
9. Principal Component Analysis(PCA)<br/>
10. DBSCAN Algorithm<br/>

This is a part of my **10 days Machine Learning Sprint** which is live on my LinkedIn.<br/>
The purpose of the sprint is to learn publicly and possibly help aspiring data scientists like me with useful content on machine learning.
