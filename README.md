**Machine Learning Algorithms Implementation**<br/>

This repository contains complete implementation of machine learning algorithms required for data science.<br/>
I have attached the databases used in the models and have added comments as per my understanding and for your reference.<br/>

Here is a list of algorithms in sequence:<br/>

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
4. Naive Bayes Classifier 
5. Decision Tree
6. Random Forest
7. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
8. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
9. k-Means Clustering
10. Hierarchical Clustering
11. DBSCAN Algorithm
12. XGBoost Algorithm
13. Neural Networks (MLP) 

This is a part of my **10-day Machine Learning Sprint**, which is live on my LinkedIn.<br/>
The purpose of the sprint is to learn publicly and possibly help aspiring data scientists like me with useful content on machine learning.

I keep myself updated with the latest happenings around AI and technology. I am always tinkering with innovative AI use cases and regularly taking part in tech events and hackathons.<br/>
