# Machine Learning Algorithms Implementation

This repository provides foundational implementation of key algorithms using different datasets. Each algorithm is implemented from scratch or using standard libraries to demonstrate its working principle. These implementations serve as a foundational resource for understanding machine learning models and their applications.

## Included Algorithms:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Na√Øve Bayes**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

These implementations provide a hands-on approach to understanding the core concepts behind these machine learning techniques.
